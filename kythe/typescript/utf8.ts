   * Holds [utf16 offset, byte offset] pairs, with each entry at least spanSize

   *
   * Hypothetically if spanSize was 1, then the table would hold
   *   [0, 0]
   *   [1, byte offset of first character]
   *   [2, byte offset of second character]
   * and so on.
   *
   * When spanSize is greater than 1, we skip intermediate entries,
   * so the first entry after zero is [spanSize, ...] and the second is
   * [spanSize*2, ...].
   *
   * There is an exception when the input UTF-16 offset is a surrogate pair.
   * Assume the UTF-16 offset is x. Since the length of a surrogate pair in
   * Node.js in 2, x+1 is still within the surrogate pair so we will skip x+1.
   * If x+1 is spanSize*n use x+2 as the start of the span instead.
   *
   * To look up the byte offset of an input UTF-16 offset, we find the first
   * span occurring before the queried offset (which we can compute using simple
   * math using spanSize) and then repeat the scan forwards to find the offset
   * within the span.
   *
   * A larger spanSize saves memory (fewer entries in the table) at the cost
   * of more CPU (need to do more scanning to find an offset).  In practice
   * it doesn't really matter that much because our input files are pretty
   * small, but the table is at least nice to prevent an O(1) scan from the
   * beginning of the file for every requested offset.
