Kythe Compilation ZIP Format (.kzip)
====================================

== Summary

This document specifies a compact persistent storage representation for
compilation records, suitable for use by Kythe to generate cross-reference data
and to apply other static analysis tools to source files.

== Background

To generate cross-references, Kythe captures a record of each compilation that
is to be indexed (_e.g.,_ a library or binary) with enough information to
enable us to replay the compilation to the front-end of the compiler.  This
record consists of a
`CompilationUnit` link:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[protobuf]
message, together with the content of all the source files and other inputs the
compiler needs to process the compilation (_e.g.,_ header files or type
snapshots from dependencies).

== Kythe ZIP Format (.kzip)

To store compilation records compactly, we use a specially formatted ZIP
archive that we call a *kzip* file, conventionally given the file extension
`.kzip`. A kzip file consists of the following directory structure:

[literal]
root/           # Any valid non-empty directory name
   units/
     abcd1234   # Compilation unit (JSON format, see below for details)
     ...        # (name is hex-coded SHA256 of record content)
   files/
     1a2b3c4e   # File contents, uncompressed
     ...        # (name is hex-coded SHA256 of uncompressed file content)

This organization separates the compilation unit descriptions from their file
data, which are shared among multiple compilations.

`.kzip` can offer alternate structures, in which compilation units are formatted in other encodings. Currently the only other encoding defined and supported is "proto". In this case, the directory structure will look like

[literal]
root/           # Any valid non-empty directory name
   pbunits/
     abcd1234   # Compilation unit (proto format, see below for details)
     ...        # (name is hex-coded SHA256 of record content)
   files/
     1a2b3c4e   # File contents, uncompressed
     ...        # (name is hex-coded SHA256 of uncompressed file content)

=== Directory and File Layout

A kzip is a ZIP file containing a top-level root directory that contains two
subdirectories, one named `units` and one named `files`.

 * The `units` (or `pbunits`) subdirectory may contain only unit files.

 * The `files` subdirectory may contain only data files.

 * Other files or directories inside the `units` or `files` subdirectories
   should cause a tool to consider the kzip file invalid.

 * Other files or subdirectories in the root or other subdirectories should be
   ignored by a tool processing the kzip file.

A *unit file* is a file containing a compilation unit description.
The name of a unit file is computed by digesting the compilation unit
with SHA256, and encoding the resulting hash as a string of lowercase
ASCII hexadecimal digits. This string becomes the filename of the unit
file. Note that the digest should only process the CompilationUnit
itself, and should not include the other contents of the wrapper
message. Details on the digesting algorithm are described below.

A *data file* is a file containing an unstructured blob of raw (uncompressed)
file data.  The name name of a data file is computed by hashing the file
contents with SHA256, and encoding the resulting hash as a string of lowercase
ASCII hexadecimal digits. This string becomes the filename of the data file.

The *root directory* must be the first entry in the ZIP file, and its name must
not be empty.

=== Compilation Unit Description Format

The content of a unit file is the canonical JSON encoding of a
`kythe.proto.IndexedCompilation` protobuf message.

[source,javascript]
{
   "unit": <encoded kythe.proto.CompilationUnit>,
   "index": {
      "revision": ["123", "456", "789"]
   }
}

The `"unit"` key is required, and must contain the canonical JSON encoding of a
`kythe.proto.CompilationUnit` protobuf message.  The `"index"` key is optional,
but if set must contain the canonical JSON encoding of an `Index` message.

For the `proto` encoding of compilation units, the content of the unit
is the standard wire-encoding of the `kythe.proto.IndexedCompilation`
protobuf message.

=== Computing the digest for a Compilation Unit

The representative implementation can be found in
`kythe/go/platform/kcd/kythe/units.go`.

==== Definitions

`NULL`::
the one-byte value corresponding to ASCII NULL (`\0x00`)
`NL`::
the one-byte value corresponding to ASCII newline (`\x0a`)

All strings are emitted in UTF-8 encoding.

==== Canonical form
For the purposes of computing the digest, a compilation unit should
be in *_canonical form_*. This is defined as:

- the field `required_input` is deduplicated and sorted according to
  `cu.required_input.path`
- the field `environment` is sorted by `environment.name`
- the field `source_file` is sorted
- the field `details` is sorted by `details.type_url`

==== Digest computation
Let `v` be a `kythe.proto.VName`. Then a digest of `v` is

....
   v.signature NULL v.corpus NULL v.root NULL v.path NULL v.language NULL
....

Let `cu` be an instance of `kythe.proto.CompilationUnit`. Then a
digest of `cu` is computed as the sequence

....
   "CU" NL cu.vname NULL
....

followed by, for each required input:

....
   "RI" NL cu.required_input[i].vname NULL
   "IN" NL cu.required_input[i].info.path NULL cu.required_input[i].info.digest NULL
....

followed by:

....
   "ARG" NL cu.argument[0] NULL cu.argument[1] NULL ...
   "OUT" NL cu.output_key NULL
   "SRC" NL cu.source_file[0] NULL cu.source_file[1] NULL ...
   "CWD" NL cu.working_directory NULL
   "CTX" NL cu.entry_context NULL
....

followed by, for each `cu.environment`:

....
   "ENV" NL cu.environment[i].name NULL cu.environment[i].value NULL
....

finally followed by, for each `cu.details`:

....
   "DET" NL cu.details[i].type_url NULL cu.details[i].value NULL
....

For the `cu.details.value`, this is the sequence of bytes of the
wire-encoding proto representation of the value.
