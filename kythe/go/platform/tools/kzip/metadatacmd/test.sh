# For the test, we use a constant string for the time. When working with a git
# repository, the timestamp can be retrieved with `git log --pretty='%ad' -n 1
# HEAD`. The format '%ad' prints out just the 'author date' of the commit. The
# format of the date can be changed with git's --date flag, but the kzip
# create_metadata command is setup to accept git's default format.
