// Package dedup implements a duplication-reducing reader for streams of
// length-delimited byte records.  Each record is read as a varint-encoded
// length in bytes, followed immediately by the record itself.
//
// A stream consists of a sequence of such records packed consecutively without
// additional padding.  There are no checksums or compression.
// See also: kythe.io/kythe/go/platform/delimited.
